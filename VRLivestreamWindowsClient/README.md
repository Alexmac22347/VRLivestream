# Windows Client

This project runs the client-side application on windows.

## Setup

The setup is identical to the VRLivestreamServer setup. Please see the README
in that directory.

## Notes

This project will hopefully be merged with the Android Client and the 
dependency on FFmpeg.Autogen removed.
